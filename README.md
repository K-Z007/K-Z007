- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m K-Z007
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Software and Web Development, Data Science and Game Design.
- ðŸŒ± I have a passion for learning new technologies, recognizing their interconnectedness. My work and leisure involves a diverse range of tools to create innovative solutions:
     - Java Spring Boot and C# with .NET:
       I use these frameworks to build robust applications and websites. Java Spring Bootâ€™s simplicity and C#'s rich ecosystem make them powerful choices.
     - Python, with libraries like pandas and numpy: 
       For data analysis and financial insights, Python is my go-to language. These libraries allow me to extract valuable information efficiently.
     - C# and Unity: 
       Game design is my creative outlet. Using C# in Unity, I craft engaging and fun games, exploring interactive experiences.
     ### And now, with AI, the possibilities are even more intriguing.
